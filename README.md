## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned responsive web design. Specifically, I learned:
- How to make images responsive using html
- How to use media queries
- how to use flexbox and grid for layout
- How to utilize min-width and max-width

see some example code below:
```html
<picture>
  <source media="(min-width: 415px)" srcset="images/image-product-desktop.jpg">
  <img src = "images/image-product-mobile.jpg" alt="An image of the Perfume"> 
</picture>
```
```css
.mainCard {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-rows: 1fr;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
    border-bottom-left-radius: 10px;
    border-bottom-right-radius: 10px;
    border-top-left-radius: 10px;
    border-top-right-radius: 10px;
    min-width: 290px;
}
```

### Continued development
Moving forward, I will continue to improve my HTML and CSS skills. Additionally, I plan on improving my js skill by doing js related projects.
